# Running-Database
This Program works as an electronic PR sheet for my Cross Country Team with features to add, modify, and remove runners

This project was originally created as part of the IB Internal Assessment in 2018. This database can be accessed by downloading
the Running Database.jar file from the Product folder and the optional Data text files. When the program is run for the first time
, it can be initialized using the text file or from scratch. For detailed information about usability and methodology for 
highschool cross country, please read the criterions and watch the video found in the documentation folder.
